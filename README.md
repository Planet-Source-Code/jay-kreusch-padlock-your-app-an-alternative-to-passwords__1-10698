## PadLock Your App\! \(An alternative to passwords\)


</div>

### Description

This is a little app I created to give some of my clients an alternative to remembering passwords. Basically, it turns floppy disks into KeyCards. The best part about this is that simply copying the disk will not create a working key! (Although Imaging the disk might, but this hasn't been tested) I would not call this High-level security, but if you need a reasonable level of security without the hassles of administering passwords, this is the code to use. Or, you could use this in addition to regular passwords to give an added level of security. Thanks to the code on this site provided by Barry Dunne for encryption. Please vote.
